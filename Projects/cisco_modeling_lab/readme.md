## CML VM set up

When to Cisco's Software Central to download CML-free

When attempting to download CML free the VM file would not run. 

I worked through several youtube tutorials but could not get a roper instalation.

Please see attached assets for screenshots off the files I downloaded. 

Once downloaded the file would only open a raw file and the VM would not deploy.

Tim's video stated a video may be released on how to install CML free, but andrew said that if we were unable to download, then it will not impact our grade.

## Diagram considerations 
Since I work from home as a Retail Analyst for a major financial institution I created two subnets. Subnet 192.168.1.0/24 was designated for all personal devices in our home, while subnet 192.168.2.0/24 was reserved for my offices PC and Desktop. This was done to create a logical seperation of the devices on our network so that I could increase the netwrok security of my work devices without impacting the connectivity for the rest of our home. 

We also used a Next Gen Router that also houses our firewall and switch. This of course was due to us wanting to limit the number of devices used to create our network. 

Since there were multiple levels to our home the connectivity was orginally much weaker on floors 1 and 3 since the Wifi needed to pass through walls and floors to reach the devices on those levels. To fix this issue we ran ethernet cables through the walls and added a Wifi extender on each level.

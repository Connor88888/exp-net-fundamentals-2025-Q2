## VPC setup 

- Created a test-VPC in AWS 
- manually set IPv4 address
- review subnets, availability zones, NAT gateway and VPC endpoints.
- Based on previous steps inputs review the subnets and route table for accuracy
- Create a peer connection to connect test VPC to network-bootcamp VPC.
- The two VPC's  will then be able to connect though he cloud providers Hypervisor.
- Then edit the route table to route traffic between the VPC's and target the peering connection.
- Make sure you edit the route table for your other VPC to send traffic back.

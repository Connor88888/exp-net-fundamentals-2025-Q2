## Live Stream 

During the first weeks class I got to watch as network engineers worked together to recreate our instructors home network. This LAN is shared between our instructor and his neighbor so that the are able to stream and download "free" movies. In the diagram they show that they have logically seperated there network with a subnet to seperate their hosuehold devices. They then provided the steps on how a packet would travel from house bron to the internet. 

## Lessons Learned in Week 1 Videos 
- We began the course by diagraming a LAN in lucid.
- Created rebo in GitHub to document learning and provide proof of work
- Setup a VPC enviornment in AWS
- Using EC2 instances in our AWS VPC we created VM's for Windows 11 and Ubuntu
- Automated depolyment for our Ubuntu VM using CFN and AWS CLI
- Automated deployment for Windows VM using Azure Bicep and CLI
- Created a basic local networking in packet tracer and diagnosed the stages of obtaining an IP Address for a new endpoint device
- Reviewed networking tools (ipconfig, tracert, route, netstat, and Ping)
- Used Python to test Windows Defender Firewall rules
- learned new Linux networking tools (sudo, nano, cat /etc.., dig, curl, lsof, python3, tcpdump, tshark)
- Launched a Debian VM from GCP to practice Linux firewall tools such as ufw, iptables, and firewalld. 


## Tools used 
- Cloud  products: Azure, GCP, AWS.
- CLI: Command Prompt, Powershell, and Bash.
- LLM's: Chat GPT and Cursor AI.
- App's for homework: Packet Tracker, Putty, Pageant, VS Code, Github. 

## Stuggles 
As a pre-requisite we had to be familiar with GitHub and how to create a repo. I personal have never had to before and I simply spent sevel hours before the first week trying to watch tutorials. I still feel like my repo is not as organized as I would need it to be to get a 4 on our grading rubric. I have also submitted a lot of commits in an effort to correct several design choises. This has graeatly increased the amount of time I required to complete this weeks homework.

 Additionally, I have been somewhat stressed due to their being no reference on the homework assignments that need to appear in the repo and how they are to be structured. I currently do not work in the networking field and I am a retail banking analyst seeking a career change into the networking security field so the lack of structure has left me quite confused.

## Successes 
Due to the amount of time I spent this last week torubleshooting between VS code and GitHub to properly submit my documentation I have final begun to feel confident in making my commits and ensuring my work is uploaded as I intend. 

For the ip_address_management project I spent hours troublshooting my azure bicep file to automate the depolyment and eventually got it to deploy. Since I paused my video to complete this process I did not realize that this was not something that was completed by our instructor.

Watched as netwroking enginners worked on crating a diagram of a metropolitan area network based on our instructors home town. They discusseed the design reasoning behind their decision to create a datacenter in an old church. 

## Lessons Learned 
- Installed Cisco Modeling Lab to complete Tim's lab 
- 


## CML notes
As opposed to Packet tracer CML does not emulate Cisco device but rather it creates real devices running through a webbrowser GUI. 

Tim is going to send out a .yaml file to connect to the lab we are going to complete for homework. 

You can pull in nodes to CML and once your layout it complete you can then run them in real time. 

In Tim's example the router is used to assign IP Addresses using DHCP since we did not establish a server to do so.

The Lab can be configured to connect to the internet so that you can test your machines connectivity.

CML bridges itself through your home network.(ex. if your tracert to 8.8.8.8 you will only get a responce from cml and you host device since your home router does not have your cml in it's route table to return packetts.)

CML uses NAT to connect to your home router and create a bridge.

In sample labs we could also use the IOSvL2 Feature Tests lab and stay within the free tier.

PCAP's can be captured in CML buy selecting the connection. 

When attempting to install CML I encorterned multiple errors and could not recreate the lab in the instructor video
